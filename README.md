# Case Study: Analyzing Customer Churn in Excel

This project involves analyzing customer churn data using Microsoft Excel to identify patterns, trends, and business insights that can help reduce churn and improve customer retention.


## Project Overview

In this case study, I explored a telecom dataset to determine which customer segments are more likely to churn and what factors contribute to customer attrition. This Excel-based project was part of a guided case study and involved a structured approach to data analysis using Excel features.


## Objectives

- Identify the churn rate and customer segments at high risk.
- Perform exploratory data analysis using PivotTables and charts.
- Create a visually interactive dashboard to present insights.
- Suggest data-driven strategies to reduce churn.


## Tools & Skills Used

- **Microsoft Excel** (2016+)
- **Power Query** for data cleaning
- **PivotTables** for aggregation and analysis
- **Formulas**: `IF`, `VLOOKUP`, `COUNTIF`, `AVERAGEIFS`, etc.
- **Conditional Formatting** for highlighting trends
- **Dashboard Design** using charts and slicers


## Key Insights

- Overall churn rate: **26.5%**
- Customers with month-to-month contracts are **3x more likely** to churn than those with two-year contracts.
- **Senior citizens** and **low tenure customers** are among the most likely to leave.
- **Fiber optic internet users** had a significantly higher churn rate compared to DSL.
